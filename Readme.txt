Game description. 

Just like the english language can refer to a noun with "a" or "an". 
The swedish languages has "en" or "ett". However, the language rules are ambiguous, 
and for a non-native Swedish speakers it's very difficult to know which one to use. This is an easy game where the programmer can add nouns
in the corresponding list and then practise/ take the quiz. 

The purpose of the game was to try out the kivy language/module for me as a novice self taught developer. 

The game was created in early 2021, with very limited programming skills in both python and kivy.
